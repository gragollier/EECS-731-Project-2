    "Using this (https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays) dataset of all the lines from all of Shakespeare's plays, the goal was to classify the player saying a given line. I choose to focus this around predicting the player from only the line and possibly the play. Although the dataset contains the act, scene, and line number, it feels a bit unrealistic to predict the player from this as at that point it could be thought of just memorization of every play. The thought process I had in mind is most people could hear the line \"To be or not to be, that is the question\" and know that the Hamlet said that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To acomplish this, I tried two main approaches. First, using the play with a custom made way to interpret the complexity of a given line by using the average number of characters per word in the line. The other, somewhat more complicated, but more realistic method I used was to using a vector embeding of the lines and try to predict based on that. "

    "As you can see, we don't really get a more accurate model even after using word embedings. In the future, I'd like to either revist how the word embedings are being generated and see if there's an issue there or try using a neural network which is well suited for the high dimensional data such as the word embedings. I would have done more of that work now, but it ended up taking me a long time to get the word embedings to even work in the first place, even though all that remains from that effort is a few lines of code. I had tried using a couple of the different embedings, with some custom parameters, but then found FastText which seemed to solve some of the sparsity problems I was having. I need to spend more time investigating whether the issue lies with the models or with the embedings themselves. "
