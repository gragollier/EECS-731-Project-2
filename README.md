# EECS731 Project 2
*Grant Gollier*

## Goal
The goal of this project is to classify which player said a given line in a Shakespeare play. I used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays). 

## Results
I didn't get the results I had hoped for with model accuracies around 22%. There is more discussion in my notebook around future work to improve this as well as possibly issues leading to this low accuracy. To see the full results and more explanation around my motivations check out my [1-Analysis Notebook](notebooks/1%20-%20Analysis.ipynb).
